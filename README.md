# Disk Storage Management Project

This Python project aims to provide a comprehensive disk storage management tool that allows users to efficiently manage their disk space. The project offers various functionalities to analyze, organize, and clean up files and folders on the disk. Below are the key features of this disk storage management tool:

## Features

1. **Display Available Free Space:** The tool will present the amount of free space available on the disk, enabling users to have a quick overview of the available storage.

2. **Space Utilization:** Users can view the amount of space utilized on the disk. The tool will provide insights into the total space used, allowing users to monitor their disk usage efficiently.

3. **Breakdown of Space Utilization:**
   - Based on Drives: The tool will categorize space utilization based on different drives present in the system, giving users a clear understanding of storage distribution across drives.
   - Based on Paths: Users can analyze the space occupied by different paths or directories, making it easier to identify storage-intensive locations.
   - Based on File Types: The tool will categorize files into types such as videos, images, documents, etc., to help users identify which file types consume the most space.

4. **Duplicate File Detection:** The project will include a feature to detect duplicate files on the disk. Users will be able to identify and remove duplicate files to free up storage space efficiently.

5. **Identify Large Files:** The tool will identify and list large files that occupy significant disk space. This feature will assist users in locating and managing large files that are no longer needed.

6. **Scan Specific File Types:** Users can specify file types they want to scan. This feature will allow targeted analysis and cleanup of specific types of files based on user preferences.

7. **Faster and Efficient Deletion:** Once insights about disk utilization are available, the tool will facilitate faster and efficient deletion of files and folders. Users can select and delete files directly from the tool's interface.

8. **Delete Files of Specific Types:** The project will provide users with the capability to delete files of specific types in bulk. This will streamline the process of removing unwanted files of a particular category.

## Usage

1. **Requirements:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries used in the project. You can install the required libraries using `pip` by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Run the Tool:** Execute the main script of the project to launch the disk storage management tool. The graphical user interface (GUI) will allow you to navigate through various features easily.

3. **View Disk Information:** The tool will display the amount of free space available on the disk and provide a breakdown of space utilization based on drives, paths, and file types.

4. **Detect and Manage Duplicate Files:** Use the duplicate file detection feature to find and remove duplicate files, optimizing disk space.

5. **Identify Large Files:** The tool will list large files for you to review and decide whether to keep or delete them.

6. **Scan Specific File Types:** You can choose specific file types to scan, making it convenient to manage files based on categories.

7. **Efficient Deletion:** Use the tool's interface to delete files and folders efficiently. You can also delete files of specific types in bulk.
